Install Node.js and npm or whatever tf that is 

so basically run index.html after saving everything else.

the script.js uses my mongoDB account but if you feel like things need to be changed, put your account and password instead.

the "mongodb://your_database_uri" in server.js has to be replaced (obviously lol) ----> THIS IS THE ISSUE SO FIND A WAY.
idek wtf a URI is.

paste the mongoDB bin path to the cmd.

put "mongod" (some 100 lines should come).

then put mongo (it says it doesn't identify or whatever) that's the main command to connect mongoDB to the shell.
